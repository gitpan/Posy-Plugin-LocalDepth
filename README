==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::LocalDepth - Posy plugin to filter by local depth


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::LocalDepth.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This plugin restricts entries to those within the $localdepth config setting
-- the "depth" of the entry is compared to the "depth" of the current
category and if the difference is more than "localdepth minus 1" then that
entry is not included in the list.

That is, with a localdepth of 1, then only entries with the same depth as
the current category are included.

If localdepth is zero, then all entries are included.

One needs to add the 'filter_by_localdepth' action to the actions list.


==   Configuration   ==

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash, which, in
the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config" file in the data
directory.

``localdepth''
The "local" depth to check. If zero, then no localdepth checking is done.


==== REQUIRES ====

    Posy
    Posy::Core

    Test::More
